# Astrobee SLAM: Simulataneous Localization and Mapping of a free-flying space robot using and EKF:robot:

Project for the Autonomous Systems course @ IST.

This project consists in localizing an Astrobee Robot (3 of which are, at the time of writing this, aboard the ISS) using an Extended Kalman Filter.

Further techinques are explored in order to counteract robot kidnapping ("instantaneous" change of pose by an external actor).
