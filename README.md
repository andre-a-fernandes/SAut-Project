# Simultaneous Localization and Mapping on a free-flying space robot using EKF-SLAM :robot:

Project done for the Autonomous Systems course @ IST, Portugal.

This project consists of both localizing an Astrobee robot (3 of which are, at the time of writing this, aboard the ISS) as well as mapping its environment using a finite number of landmarks, through an Extended Kalman Filter.

Further techinques are explored in order to counteract robot kidnapping ("instantaneous" change of pose by an external actor).

## File Structure

### > Operate the code with `localization.py`

### > Extended Kalman Filter (`ekf.py`)

### > Environment map definition (`map.py`)

### > Misc. handy methods (`utils.py`)
